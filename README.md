# DAH (DAtaset Hassaniya)

## Project Overview

**DAH (DAtaset Hassaniya)** is the first publicly available, open-source dataset for Hassaniya Arabic. Hassaniya is a dialect of Arabic spoken in Mauritania. Despite its widespread use, the language is not well-represented in digital resources.

The primary goal of the DAH project is to bridge this gap. By creating a high-quality dataset, we aim to facilitate:

1.  **Machine Translation:** The development of accurate translation tools between English and Hassaniya. This is crucial for improving technologies like online translators and other AI-driven language models.
2.  **Linguistic Research:** Providing researchers with a structured dataset to study the grammar, vocabulary, and nuances of the Hassaniya dialect.
3.  **Language Preservation:** Documenting Hassaniya in a digital format that is accessible to both the Hassaniya-speaking community and a global audience.

## Dataset Details

The DAH dataset is structured as a parallel corpus, meaning that each entry consists of a sentence in English paired with its translation in Hassaniya.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `english` | The source sentence in English. |
| `hassaniya-ar` | The Hassaniya translation written in the traditional Arabic script. |
| `hassaniya-en` | The Hassaniya translation written in a Latin-based script, often referred to as "Arabizi." |

*   **Source:** The sentences are adapted from the Tatoeba Project (https://tatoeba.org) , a large, community-based collection of sentences and translations.
*   **Quality:** All entries have been reviewed by the founders of the Hassan-IA community to ensure accuracy.
*   **License:** The dataset is released under the CC-BY-4.0 license, which allows for open use and adaptation, provided that appropriate credit is given.

## The Hassaniya Latin Script

To maintain consistency, a standardized transliteration system is used to convert Hassaniya from the Arabic script to the Latin script (`hassaniya-en`). This system employs a combination of Latin letters and numbers to represent Arabic sounds that do not have a direct equivalent in the English alphabet.

| Arabic Letter | Number or Latin alphabet |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ا** (a) | **2** |
| **ح** (Ḥa) | **7** | 
| **خ** (Khā) | **5** | 
| **ذ** (Dhāl) | **4** | 
| **ط** (Ṭa) | **6** | 
| **ظ** (Ẓa) | **8** |
| **ق** (Qāf) | **9** |
| **ع** (ʿAyn) | **3** |
| **غ** (Ghāyn) | **gh** |
| **ض** (Ḍad) | **dh** |
| **گ** (Gāf) | **G** |

**A Note on Vowels:** The dataset intentionally includes variations such as "ou" and "u" for the same sound. This reflects the actual usage of the language in digital contexts, particularly among younger speakers.
